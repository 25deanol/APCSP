	<p>	In honors chemistry, I did some cool labs which was enjoyable. In spanish I learned the present perfect tense and commands and some other stuff and that was cool. In APCSP I learned about some algorithms and how to code stuff. In financial literacy I learned about stocks and other finance things. In math I learned trigonmetrey and identities and things like that. In English I read 2 or 3 books and wrote 2 essays. In modern world history, I learned about a lot of wars and how they were bad. Overall, it was all enjoyable.
