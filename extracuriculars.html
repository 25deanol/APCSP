	<p>During this school year, there were some ups and downs, I did great on my pSAT but I did badly on some honors chem tests. Then, I went to Antartica and found big penguins with my soccer team. Unfrotunatley, we lost the soccer finals in game 7. I participated in many sports, including snowboarding and surfing as well as soccer. I did track in the spring and set a few new PRs, and to top off the great things I did this year, I won the national Go tournament. </p>
