	<p>During this school year, I went to Antartica and found big penguins with my soccer team. Unfrotunatley, we lost the soccer finals in game 7. I participated in many sports, including snowboarding and surfing. I did track in the spring and set a few new PRs, and to top off the great things I did this year, I won the national Go tournament. </p>

           <p>I loved surfing this year because of how involved with nature it is. When I'm on the water I feel at peace with the world and its very cool. I've learned that its important to pay attention to your surroudnings as a result of surfing. In track, I learned that you gotta use good form to do stuff well because other wise you might mess up and hurt yourself. Track is important to me because it gives me a thing to do after school and helps me set goals such as achieving a new PR, and the community is great. Another thing that was important to me was the gym, it helps me get stronger so I don't get injured as much and I enjoy lifting stuff a lot because I typically go with my friends. </p>
